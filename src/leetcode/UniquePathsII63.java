 * Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
 现在考虑如果网格中添加了一些障碍。 有多少独特的路径呢？
 An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
 障碍物和空格分别在网格中标记为1和0。
 For example,
 There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

 [
 [0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]
 ]
 The total number of unique paths is 2.

 Note: m and n will be at most 100.
